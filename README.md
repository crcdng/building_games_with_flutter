# building_games_with_flutter

Updated code of the book "Building Games with Flutter" by Paul Teale / Packt

for Flame 1.14 / Flutter 3.16

- https://flame-engine.org/
- https://flutter.dev/

Rationale: I found the book to be a good comprehensive introduction to game development with the Flame game engine. However, Flame has changed a lot since the book came out. So I updated the code as I went through the chapters as an exercise. I left most of the code intect with two the notable differences: adding components to the `world` instead of the game object, and tweaking the particle effect. Checked chapter 8 on web, and other chapters on macOS.

TODO: test on mobile, refactor a few places, tweak parameters

Platform folders are not in git so you have to add them yourself.
